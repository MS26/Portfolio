### Inspiration

Designing sites is definitely not my forte. So whilst I did build this site from the ground up, I took design inspiration from [v4.brittanychiang.com](https://v4.brittanychiang.com).

### TL;DR

You are welcome to fork this repository. However, as I have done, please give me credit by linking back to [matthew-sutton.com](https://matthew-sutton.com). Thanks!
